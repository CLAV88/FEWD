        <h2>JQuery is just a Javascript library that can be called using the "$" character. It is considered an object, specifically a function, that takes in two args and returns a result. </h2>

                'Interestingly enough the Jquery scripts can only be used on tags and elements that come before them in the DOM, so its taking a snapshot of what has loaded and working with it up to that point.'
