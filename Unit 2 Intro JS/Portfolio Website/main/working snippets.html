				<p class = "bottom">The color of the falcon’s back is bluish-gray with the black head.The peregrine falcon reaches up to 34 – 58 cm (13 – 23 in), they weigh 440 g to 750 g (0.97 – 1.7 lb).In the 1950s, peregrine numbers began to drop, and by the mid 1960s, the falcon had disappeared from Ontario. Eventually, it was discovered that the pesticide DDT was responsible for the birds’ decline.</p>
