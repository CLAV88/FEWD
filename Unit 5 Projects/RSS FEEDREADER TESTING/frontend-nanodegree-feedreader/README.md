# Overview
## This is our RSS feed reader application. It uses the Google Feed Reader API to grab RSS feeds as JSON object we can make use of.

# The project can be run by opening app.js, the feedreader.js file launches the test suite to test whether the feed reader is working properly.

#Please enjoy.
